                "Since bloon bots and farmers look exactly like abilities and are in the exact same ui element as abilities, some players get tripped up hitting the wrong ability hotkey, at least until they get used to farmers and bloon bots being there. This was a major issue when bloon bots and farmers were first introduced, and while most HoM players have gotten used to it, newer players are still likely to get confused. If bloon bots and farmers showed at the end of the ability list rather than the beginning, this would not be an issue."
